# Inkpot - Narrative Side Effects

A simple FoundryVTT module that displays a message whenever a Skill Check in D&D 4e is rolled. The side effects are meant to encourage more narrative play, inspired by the [FFG Genesys](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/genesys/products/genesys-core-rulebook/) system.

The message suggests a side effect based on the d20 roll as displayed in the following table:

| Roll | Side Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | TERRIBLE |
| 2 | AMAZING |
| 3 | Bad |
| 4 | Good |
| 5 | Bad |
| 6 | Good |
| 7 | none |
| 8 | none |
| 9 | none |
| 10 | none |
| 11 | none |
| 12 | none |
| 13 | none |
| 14 | none |
| 15 | Bad |
| 16 | Good |
| 17 | Bad |
| 18 | Good |
| 19 | TERRIBLE |
| 20 | AMAZING |
